Description:
-
Hello everyone! this is my university dissertation project by using unity to create a 3D chess game. The Chess folder is the source code of the game, you can download and import it on your unity!


If you inserting the project into unity hub:
-
 you will notice that there is an empty scene. it is because when you open a project in Unity, Unity has to recreate the Library, the empty default scene gets loaded. Just double click on your Scenes folder and open the saved scene to solve this problem.
